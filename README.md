# String Calculator - Incubyte TDD Kata

This project is an implementation of the *String Calculator Kata* using *Test-Driven Development (TDD)*.  
It is designed to showcase incremental feature development, unit testing, and clean code practices.

---

## ✨ Features Implemented

✅ *Empty Input Returns Zero*
> An empty string returns 0.  
Example: "" => 0

✅ *Single Number Returns That Number*
> A string containing a single number returns that number itself.  
Example: "101" => 101

✅ *Two Numbers, Comma-Delimited*
> Two comma-separated numbers return their sum.  
Example: "100,202" => 302

✅ *Multiple Numbers, Comma-Delimited*
> Multiple comma-separated numbers are summed correctly.  
Example: "100000,200000,300000,400000" => 1,000,000

✅ *Newline as Delimiter*
> Newline characters can be used as delimiters together with commas.  
Example: "100\n200,3" => 303

✅ *Custom Single-Character Delimiter*
> The delimiter can be specified as a single character.  
Example: "//;\n100;201" => 301

✅ *Custom Delimiter of Any Length*
> Delimiters of any length are supported in square brackets.  
Example: "//[***]\n10***40***1" => 51

✅ *Trailing Delimiters Ignored*
> Trailing delimiters are safely ignored without error.  
Example: "1,2,3," => 6

✅ *Whitespace Handling*
> Spaces around numbers and delimiters are ignored.  
Example: " 1 , 2 , 3 ,, " => 6

✅ *Negative Number Validation*
> Negative numbers are not allowed. If found, an exception is thrown listing all negative values.  
Example:
- Input: "1,-2"  
  Exception: negative numbers not allowed: -2
- Input: "-19,-20,3"  
  Exception: negative numbers not allowed: -19,-20

✅ *Large Input Performance*
> Efficient summation of 1000+ numbers.  
Example: Sum of 1 to 1000 returns 500500.

✅ *(Partial) Multiple Custom Delimiter Parsing*
> Some support for multiple delimiters (//[*][%]\n), though not fully implemented in splitting logic yet (you may extend this).
